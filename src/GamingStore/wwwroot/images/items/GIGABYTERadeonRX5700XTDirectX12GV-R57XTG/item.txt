  "Description": "Radeon™ RX 5700 XT GAMING 8GGV-R57XTGAMING-8GD\r\nFeatures\r\nPowered by AMD Radeon™ RX 5700 XT\r\nIntegrated with 8GB GDDR6 256-bit memory interface\r\nWINDFORCE 3X Cooling System with alternate spinning fans\r\nRGB Fusion 2.0 – 16.7M colors synchronize with other AORUS devices\r\nMetal Back Plate\r\nPCI-Express 4.0 Support\r\nCore Clock\r\nBoost Clock : up to 1905 MHz\r\nGame Clock* : 1755 MHz\r\nBase Clock : 1605 MHz\r\nWINDFORCE 3X COOLING SYSTEM\r\nThe WINDFORCE 3X cooling system features 3x 80mm unique blade fans, alternate spinning fan, 5 composite copper heat pipes, heat-pipe direct touch and 3D active fan functionality, together delivering an effective heat dissipation capacity for higher performance at lower temperatures.\r\nALTERNATE SPINNING\r\nThe GIGABYTE \"Alternate Spinning\" is the only solution that can solve the turbulent airflow of three fans. The biggest problem with the three fans is turbulence. Since the fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction is opposite between the fans, which will cause turbulent airflow and reduce heat dissipation efficiency. GIGABYTE turns the middle fan in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.\r\nUNIQUE BLADE FAN\r\nThe airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface, effectively enhancing the airflow.\r\n3D ACTIVE FAN\r\nThe 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. It allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle.\r\nHEAT PIPES DIRECT TOUCH GPU\r\nThe shape of the pure copper heat pipes maximize the direct contact area with the GPU, enhancing heat transfer. The heat pipes also cover the VRAM through a large metal plate contact to ensure proper cooling.\r\nCOMPOSITE HEAT-PIPE\r\nThe composite heat-pipe combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently manage the heat transfer between two solid interfaces which increases cooling capacity.\r\nGAME IN STYLE\r\nRGB FUSION 2.0\r\nWith 16.7M customizable color options and numerous lighting effects, you can choose lighting effects or synchronize with other AORUS devices.\r\nBUILT STRONG\r\nEXTREME DURABILITY\r\nThe graphics card uses the better power phases design to allow the MOSFET to operate at lower temperature, and over-temperature protection design and load balancing for each MOSFET, plus the Ultra Durable certified chokes and capacitors, to provide excellent performance and longer system life.\r\nFRIENDLY PCB DESIGN\r\nFully automated production process ensures top quality of the circuit boards and eliminates sharp protrusions of the solder connectors seen on the conventional PCB surface. This friendly design prevents your hands from getting cut or inadvertently damaging components when making your build.\r\nPOWER INDICATOR\r\nThe smart power LED indicator alerts the player when any PCI-E power supply is abnormal.\r\nLight on: power cable disconnected\r\nLight off: stable power supply\r\nBlinking: abnormal power supply\r\nPROTECTION METAL BACK PLATE\r\nThe metal back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.\r\nPCI-E 4.0 SUPPORT\r\nGigabyte Radeon RX 5700 XT GAMING features PCI-Express 4.0 support, with a throughput of 16 GT/s and enables two times the bandwidth compared to PCI Express 3.0. With the PCI-Express 4.0 supported motherboard, and get ready for the next generation of PC gaming.\r\nIN TOTAL COMMAND\r\nThe interface and functionality of the software is subject to each model.\r\nAORUS ENGINE\r\nThe cutting edge intuitive interface allows you to adjust the clock speed, voltage, fan performance and power target in real-time according to your game's requirements.\r\nRadeon™ FreeSync Technology Radeon™ Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition\r\nNo stuttering. No tearing. Just gaming. Radeon™ FreeSync technology puts an end to choppy gameplay and broken frames with fluid, artifact-free performance at virtually any framerate. A seamless way to replay gameplay. Radeon™ Graphics' sophisticated power management utility. Bringing cool and quiet frames on countless number of games.",
