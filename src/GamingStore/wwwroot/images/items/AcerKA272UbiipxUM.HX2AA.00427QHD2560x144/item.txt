The ZeroFrame design lets you place multiple monitors next to each other for a seamless, almost uninterrupted view.\r\nNo Screen Tearing\r\nSay goodbye to stuttering and tearing with AMD Radeon FreeSync* technology and a 75Hz refresh rate. Video editing is smoother as the monitor's refresh rate is synched to your computer's framerate. No matter what you're working on, the 1ms Visual Response Boost ensures clear, blur-free images.\r\nEye Safety First\r\nProtect your eyes from unnecessary strain by utilizing Acer BlueLightShield and Flickerless technologies. View your monitor for longer with reduced glare and eye fatigue thanks to Acer ComfyView and Low Dimming.\r\nAdjustments On The Fly\r\nNo need to fiddle with buttons. Easily modify your monitor settings via the Display Widget utility software. Customize your viewing by selecting different modes for different apps.\r\nExacting Colors\r\nAcer monitors use a unique form of 6-axis color adjustment in order to aid professionals in obtaining the exact color and hue they prefer. Using this feature, the user can adjust hue and saturation in 6 axes. These axes range from R, G, B to C, M and Y, and allow the user to cater the monitor's colors to their professional needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n*For Radeon FreeSync technology, users will require: a monitor compatible with Adaptive-Sync, a compatible Radeon GPU, and a compatible Radeon Software graphics driver.",
